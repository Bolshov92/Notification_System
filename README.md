# Notification Service

## Introduction

The Notification Service is part of a microservices architecture designed to manage and send notifications based on events. This service interacts with various databases and other microservices to deliver a cohesive notification system, capable of handling contact uploads, event notifications, and SMS alerts.

## Requirements

Before you can run the Notification Service, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Docker**: Ensure that Docker is installed and running.
- **Docker Compose**: Required for orchestrating the multiple services.

## Environment Variables

You need to configure environment variables for your databases and services. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_mysql_root_password
CONTACT_DB_PASSWORD=your_contact_db_password
EVENT_DB_PASSWORD=your_event_db_password
FILE_DB_PASSWORD=your_file_db_password
NOTIFICATION_DB_PASSWORD=your_notification_db_password
SMS_DB_PASSWORD=your_sms_db_password
USER_DB_PASSWORD=your_user_db_password
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number

Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual passwords and tokens.

Docker Compose Configuration
The project uses Docker Compose to manage the services. Below is a brief overview of the services defined in docker-compose.yml:

MySQL Databases: Separate databases for contacts, events, files, notifications, SMS, and users.
Microservices:
Contact Service: Manages contact information.
Event Service: Handles events triggering notifications.
File Service: Processes CSV file uploads for contacts.
Notification Service: Creates and manages notifications.
SMS Service: Sends SMS notifications using a provider like Twilio.
User Service: Manages user authentication and information.

Starting the Application
To run the Notification Service, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Open your terminal and clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Bolshov92/Notification_System
cd Notification_System
Create the .env File: Create a .env file in the root directory and configure the environment variables as described above.

Start the Services: Use Docker Compose to start the services:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
The -d flag runs the containers in detached mode.

Check the Status: You can check the status of the services by running:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose ps
View Logs: To view logs for all services, use:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose logs -f
This command will display the logs in real-time.

Authentication
To access the Notification Service, you'll need to authenticate as an admin. Use the following credentials:

Username: ADMIN
Password: admin
You can authenticate by making a POST request to the authentication endpoint:

http
Copy code
POST http://localhost:8086/api/users/authenticate
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "userName": "ADMIN",
    "password": "admin"
}
If the credentials are correct, you will receive a JWT token in response.

## Scheduling Notifications

To create a notification schedule, specify the following parameters in your request:

- **fileName**: The name of the uploaded file.
- **eventName**: The name of the event.
- **sendTime**: The scheduled time for sending notifications.

### Example Request

Hereâ€™s an example of a JSON request to schedule notifications:

   json
{
    "fileName": "contactS.csv",
    "eventName": "TEST",
    "sendTime": "2024-10-24T06:00:00Z"
}

SMS Provider Configuration
For SMS notifications, you will need to configure your SMS provider settings (e.g., Twilio) in the .env file:

plaintext
Copy code
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
Ports
Ensure to access each service through the respective ports:

Contact Service: 8081
Event Service: 8082
File Service: 8083
Notification Service: 8087
SMS Service: 8085
User Service: 8086

Conclusion
The Notification Service is a robust system for managing notifications through a microservices architecture. Ensure you have configured your environment variables correctly and follow the steps above to run the application successfully.
